**Hacking Android OS**

- Include an OS, middleware, and key applications
- Android is a linux-based OS
- Android device administration API: provide **device administration features** at the system level. Allow developers to create **security-aware** apps that useful in enterprise setting.
- Android Rooting
  - Allow users to **attain privileged control**
  - Involve exploiting security vulnerabilities in the **device firmware** and copying the SU binary to a location in the current process&#39;s PATH and granting it exetuable permission with the **chmod command**
  - Tools: **KingoRoot, One Click Root, TunesGo Root Android Tool**
- Blocking WIFI access using **NetCut**
- Identify attack surfaces using **drozer**
- Hacking with **zANTI** and **Network Spoofer**
- Launch DoS using **LOIC**
- Session hijacking using DroidSheep
- Hacking with **Orbot Proxy** : A proxy app that empowers other apps to privately use the Internet
- Exploiting android device through **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)** using **PhoneSploit**
  - ADB: Allow attackers to communicate with the target device
- Sniffer: FaceNiff
- Launch **MITD (Man in the disk)** attack: Lead to the installation of potential malicious app
- Launch spearphone attack: Allow apps to **record loudspeaker data** without privileges.
- Android trojans: **Gustuff, xHelper**
- Hacking tools: **cSploit, Fing-Network Tools**
- Security tools: **Kaspersky mobile av**
- Device tracking tools: **google find my device**
- Vulnerability scanners: **X-ray**
- Online Android analyzers: **Online APK analyzer**

**Hacking IOS**

- Jailbreaking IOS
  - The process of **installing a modified set of kernel patches** that allow users to run third-party apps not signed by the OS vendor
  - Provide root access
  - Remove **sandbox restrictions**
  - Types of jailbreaking
    - Userland exploit: Allow **user level access**
    - iBoot Exploit: Allow both user level access and iboot level access
    - Bootrom Exploit: Allow both user level access and iboot level access
  - Jailbreaking techniques
    - **Untethered jailbreaking:** In an untethered jailbreak, if the user turns the device off and back on, the device will start up completely and the kernel will be patched without the help of a computer; in other words, **the device will be jailbroken after each reboot.**
    - **Semi-tethered jailbreaking:** In a semi-tethered jailbreak, if the user turns the device off and back on, the device will start up completely. It will no longer have a patched kernel, but it will still be usable for normal functions. To use jailbroken addons, the user needs to start the device with the help of the jailbreaking tool.

    - **Tethered jailbreaking:** With a tethered jailbreak, if the device starts up on its own, it will no longer have a patched kernel, and it may get stuck in a partially started state; to start it completely and with a patched kernel, it essentially must be &quot;re-jailbroken&quot; with a computer (using the &quot;boot tethered&quot; feature of a jailbreaking tool) each time it is turned on.
    - **Semi-untethered Jailbreaking:** A semi-untethered jailbreak is similar to a **semi-tethered jailbreak**. In this type of jailbreak, when the device reboots, the kernel is not patched. However, the kernel can be patched without using a computer; it is patched using an app installed on the device.
  - Jailbreaking IOS 13.2 using **Cydia**
  - Jailbreaking IOS 13.2 using **Hexxa Plus**
- Tools: **Apricot** , a web-based mirror operating system for all the latest iphones
- Hacking using **Spyzie**
- Hacking network using **Network Analyzer Pro**
- **IOS trustjacking:** A vulnerability that can be exploited to read messages and emails and capture sensitive info from a remote location without the victim&#39;s knowledge. Exploit the &quot;ITunes WIFI Sync&quot; feature, where the victim connects their phone to any trusted computer that is already infected by an attacker
- Malware: **Clicker Trojan malware, Trident**
- Hacking tools: **Elcomsoft Phone breaker**
- Security Tools: **Avira mobile security**
- Tracking tools: **Find my iphone**

**Mobile Device Management (MDM)**

- Solutions: **IBM MaaS360, Citrix Endpoint Management**
- **BYOD** : Bring your own device is a policy thatâ€¦
- BYOD Policy implementation:
  - Define requirements
  - Select the device and build a technology portfolio
  - Develop policies
  - Security
  - Support

**Mobile Security Guidelines and Tools**

- OWASP Top10 Mobile Controls
  - Identify and protect sensitive data on the mobile device
  - Handle password credentials securely on the device
  - Ensure sensitive data are protected in transit
  - Implement user authentication, authorization, and session management correctly
  - Keep the backend APIs (services) and platform (server) secure
  - Secure data integration with third-party services and applications
  - Pay specific attention to the collection and storage of consent for the collection and use of the user&#39;s data
  - Implement controls to prevent unauthorized access to paid-for resources
  - Ensure secure distribution /provisioning of mobile apps
  - Carefully check any runtime interpretation of code for errors
