**Module 05: Vulnerability Analysis**

**Vulnerability Research**

- The process of analyzing protocols, services, and configurations to discover vulnerabilities and design flaws that will expose an OS and its applications to exploit, attack, or miuse.
- Classfied based on severity level and exploit range (local, remote)

**Vulnerabilities Assessment**

- An in-depth examination of the ability of a system or application, including current security procedures and cointrols, to withstand the exploitation.
- Recognize, measure, and classfy security vulnerabilities in a computer system, network, and communication channels.

**Vulnerability Scoring System and Databases**

- **CVSS** : Common Vulnerability Scoring System, provide an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT vulnerabilities.
- **CVE** : Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, a publicly available and free-to-use list od dic of standardized identifiers for common…
- **NVD** : National Vulnerability Database, a **US government repository** of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the **SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)**
- **CWE:** Common Weakness Enumeration, **a category system** for software vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

**Vulnerability Assessment Life-Cycle**

- Identifies assets and create a baseline
- vulnetability scan
- risk assessment
- remediation
- verification
- monitor

**Vulnerability Classfication**

- Misconfiguration
- Default Installation
- Buffer Overflow
- Unpatched Servers
- Design Flaws
- OS Flaws
- Application Flaws
- Open Services
- Default Passwords

**Types of Vulnerability Assessment**

- **Active Assessments**  : actively sending requests to the live network and examining the the responses. It requires probing the target host.
- **Passive Assessments**  : includes packet sniffing to discover vulnerabilities, running services, open ports, and others. It is a process without interfering the target host.
- **External Assessment**  : find out vulnerabilities and exploit them from outside.
- **Internal Assessment**  : find and exploit vulnerabilities in the internal network.

**Vulnerability Assessment Solutions**

**Product based solution vs Service based solution**

- **Product based solutions**  are deployed within the network. Usually dedicated for internal network.
- **Service based solutions**  are third-party solutions which offers security and auditing. This can be host either inside or outside the network. This can be a security risk of being compromised.

**Tree-based Assessment vs Inference-based Assessment**

- **Tree-based Assessment**  is the approach in which auditor follows different strategies for each component of an environment
- **Inference-based Assessment**  is the approach to assist depending on the inventory of protocols in an environment
